Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a computational method used for simulating fluid flows. Unlike traditional grid-based methods, SPH is a meshless Lagrangian particle method where the fluid is represented by a set of discrete particles that carry physical properties such as mass, density, and velocity.

The fundamental principle of SPH lies in its interpolation method, where any physical quantity of a particle is approximated by summing the contributions from neighboring particles weighted by a smoothing kernel function. This kernel function determines how strongly neighboring particles influence each other based on their distance.
